# NeuralNetwork
This a repository , where a code to generate, train and test recurrent neural networks is stored.
The following steps are yet to be done:

1) Create a database for the Network system (Tensor)
2) Write all relevant c++ classes
3) Test all relevant classes (use Boost or an equivalent library)
4) Implement MPI
5) Write python interface for c++ backend
6) Combine python interface with MPI structure to make it run on the Cluster
7) Train Network
